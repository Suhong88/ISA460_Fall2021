{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Due date: Wednesday 10/6 at midngiht\n\nThis is a group assignment. You may form a team of 4 on your own to work on this project. As a team, you will answer the following two questions:\n- What does the data suggest about scholastic’s distribution channels, and how would you recommend structuring a distribution strategy? \n- What other publically available data can you append (Census, state, region, etc.), to provide further insight?. Please import data into this notebook and join existing data to conduct additional analysis.\n\nPlease develop proper queries to answer the above questions (label each question) and write a few paragraphs at the end to discuss your findings. You need to visualize your query if appropriate. Please also develop one or two dashboards to summarize your results.\n\n#### Deliverables: a completed notebook (in html format) with your queries, visulization and dashboards. Please submit the notebook on the Canvas by the due date."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"b52e5692-9209-4e64-861b-77ed20d08437"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##[Scholastic Data Challenge](http://sc.aisnet.org/student-leadership-conference/student-chapter-comp/analytics-challenge/)\n\n### What will the children’s book market look like in the future?\n\nScholastic is a major international publishing, educational, and media company with a focus on books and educational materials designed to support children’s literacy and cultivate a passion for reading and knowledge which will continue throughout life. Scholastic’s mission is driven by its credo LINK which articulates this goal for the company.\n\nScholastic has many different channels through which it distributes the books it publishes. At times these channels work collaboratively to reach new customers in different ways, but at times there can be significant overlap between these channels. Through analyzing the interactions of these channels Scholastic seeks to better understand the children’s book market, vis-a-vis demographics, geography, genre, and price.\n\nIn the spirit of Scholastic’s mission of cultivating learning, the provided data is presented in a realistic manner, as a small snapshot of Scholastic’s sales between two separate distribution channels across the nation. In an effort to make this a realistic scenario, the data presented is not fully cleaned and there are many additional interesting variables which it is the job of the analyst to identify and evaluate.\n\nStart your analysis by answering question 1 below, and then answer at least one or more of the remaining questions.\n\n1. What trends do you see in the data, among / demographics, genre/ theme, and price?\n2. What does the data suggest about Scholastic’s distribution channels, and how would you recommend structuring a distribution strategy?\n3. What other publically available data can you append (Census, state, region, etc.), to provide further insight?\n4. Formulate a unified strategy for marketing between the two channels. Where are there areas of significant overlap between the channels, and what strategy do you suggest to prevent unintentional competition between channels?\n\nBelow are all features in this dataset\n\n- Title: Title of product sold\n- TITLE_CODE: Unique ID for titles\n- CHANNEL: Masked channel description of channel through which the product was distributed to the customer\n- PROD_TYP: Indicator if the product is a paperback or hardback\n- SERIES: Y/N indicator if the product is part of a series\n- CH1_GENRE: Genre listing for product from Channel 1 database\n- CH1_THEME: Theme listing for product from Channel 1 database\n- CH2_CATEGORY: Category listing for product from Channel 2 database\n- CH2_SUBCATEGORY: Subcategory listing for product from Channel 2 database\n- LEXILE_11_DESC: Lexile measures for product.
